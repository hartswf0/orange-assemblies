## About The Project

"Orange Assemblies" is an interactive web portfolio concept designed to break away from traditional linear presentations. Inspired by modular synthesizers and minimalist graphic design, this system presents projects as a "grove" of interactive oranges. Each orange, on hover, "slices open" to reveal its internal components: individual content segments. This approach emphasizes modularity, discoverability, and a playful, tactile user experience.

The core idea is that every project is an "assembly" of discrete parts (segments), and the interaction of "peeling" or "slicing" the orange reveals these inner workings.

## Features

*   **Interactive Oranges:** Hover over each orange to transition from a whole, minimalist form to a "sliced" view, revealing its internal structure.
*   **Modular Content Segments:** Each project contains a variable number of segments (from 1 to 6), each representing a specific piece of content (e.g., project description, image, code snippet).
*   **Consistent Layout:** Interactive circular dots are always positioned consistently in a 6-slice radial pattern, ensuring visual harmony even when some segments are hidden.
*   **Dynamic Modals:** Clicking a segment dot opens a modal displaying detailed content, supporting various types like text, images (SVGs), and code blocks.
*   **Clean Transitions:** Smooth CSS transitions enhance the interactive experience for hover states and modal animations.
*   **Thematic Aesthetic:** A unique citrus-themed, minimalist visual language with bold colors and clean lines.
*   **Responsive Design:** Adapts fluidly across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** Semantic structure for the page and dynamic content.
*   **CSS3:** Styling, layout (CSS Grid, Flexbox), custom properties (`var()`), and all visual transitions/animations.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Core interactivity, dynamic element creation, segment positioning logic, and Web Audio API for subtle sound feedback.
*   **SVG:** Used for the primary orange shapes, internal slices, and custom cursor elements, ensuring scalability and crisp visuals.
