🟠✨ Prompt: “Orange Assemblies” – Teenage Engineering Style Modular Portfolio

> Design a modular, touch-responsive portfolio experience titled Orange Assemblies, inspired by the design philosophy of Teenage Engineering. The interface is playful yet precise, combining stark minimalism with quirky physicality. Oranges are not photoreal — they’re vector-based or stylized 3D blobs with character. Each fruit is a modular interface object, designed like a small synth: expressive, functionally mysterious, and fun to touch.

Visual Language:

Flat or mildly textured oranges that bob or wobble on tap.

Peel states are animated like interface toggles or sliders — slide to peel, rotate to reveal slices.

UI uses a minimal grid of modular oranges, each with eccentric motion — maybe one drifts, another pulses in time.

Typography is clean, monospace or geometric (like DIN or Px Grotesk).

Background is either stark white, deep black, or offbeat color like #f5df4d or #e4f6f8.

🎛️ Interface Behaviors:

Tap an orange → it jumps and makes a sound (pop, click, fizz).

Hold → peel animates outward like a control ring.

Drag → slices spin around the core like a radial UI dial.

Slice tapped → opens content in a small modular window (like an OP-Z screen).

Back gesture collapses it like a snapped module.

🧡 Concept Copy Examples:

“Every segment a sample. Every project a loop.”

“This is not a portfolio. It’s a citrus sequencer.”

“Touch to recompose the grove.”

🧩 System Logic:

Oranges = nodes

Slices = modules

Heuristics = firmware messages (e.g., “data unstable // sweet signal”)

Peel States = UI skin modes: fresh / scored / juiced / dried



---

🔊 Audio Integration (Optional but Teenage Engineering™):

Tiny pops or plucks when touching

Soft peel rustle when expanding

Ambient citrus synth pad looping behind everything

Heuristics voiced by a robotic whisper, or hidden in modulator-style UI labels
